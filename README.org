** Installing a Release Egg (easiest)
1. Go to [[https://github.com/FIX-ME/deluge-quota/releases][releases]].
2. Download the latest release egg.
3. In Deluge go to ~Preferences -> Plugins~, click ~Install plugin~,
   then find where you downloaded the egg and select it.
** Build an Egg
On Linux, clone this git repo and run ~./distribute.sh~.
* Preferences
** Save download and upload totals on quit

* Development
On Linux, run ~./create_dev_link.sh~ which will create a link file in
your Deluge plugins folder. This way you can work on the plugin
without having to reinstall it to test every change.

However you still have to restart Deluge to test latest changes.
